Application scenarios
---------
In this section we provide a step-by-step explanation of two application scenarios of EpiRegio. The two scenarios are similar to those in our paper 'EpiRegio: Analysis and retrieval of regulatory elements linked
to genes' (TODO: add link). 


Application scenario 1: How to use EpiRegio to identify TF's target genes using ChIP-seq peak regions?
=================
TODO: add intro, and say that we show it examplary on ARID3A


Step 1. Downloaded the binding locations of the TF ARID3A from the ENCODE database (Accession: ENCFF002CVL) as a
BED file and store it as ...

Step 2. Use EpiRegios Region query to search for REMs overlapping at least by 50% with the TF-ChIP peaks 

Step 3. Click to ... perform a function enrichment analysis using g:Profiler with default parameters (TODO: in the paper it is not the defaul setting, do we use the defaul settings on the website?).



Application scenario 2: How to use EpiRegio to identify enriched TFs of a set of genes of interest
